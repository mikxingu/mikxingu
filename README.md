## Hi!  üáßüá∑ üë®‚Äçüíª üñ•Ô∏è

My name is Michel Alves, but people call me "Mike".

I'm a creative, innovative self taught developer from Brazil. Currently I'm working at Banco Santander, using mainly Java, the Spring Framework and the Apache Camel Framework.

My carreer mantra is "Countinuous Learning". I've started my Dev carreer around 2019, but I've been in the IT industry since 2011. <br>
Life as a programmer allows me to explore my creativity, and building software that helps people and solve day-to-day problems is what motivates me the most.

My specialty is back-end development, but I've worked with some front-end frameworks.


## Personal Interests and Goals
### My interests are:

* Coding üë®‚Äçüíª
* Coffee Drinking ‚òï
* Motorcycle Riding üèçÔ∏è
* Traveling/Camping üèïÔ∏è
* Back-End Development
* Game Development using C# and Unity

### My carreer goals are:

- [x] Start working professionally as a developer at a Tech Company - ‚úîÔ∏è Started on May/2021.
- [ ] Be recognized as a Senior Software Engineer.
- [ ] Travel overseas before my 30's. (if possible, moving to work in another country).
- [ ] Give a speech on a big Tech conference after some years of experience (Minimum 5).

## A brief history about me

I started my Dev journey using C#. This is the language used by the Unity Editor, and it was the door for me to enter the world of software development.
After a few months experimenting with the engine and following some tutorials, I started to dig deep into the C# frameworks and how it works. As development is an ocean of technologies and there are many different possibilities, I started testing Java, Python, React, Angular, PHP, NodeJS, and so on... At the time, I was still unsure on what tech stack I should focus. After carefully thinking of all the possibilities, around April/2021 I decided that I'd go all in on the .NET framework stack, and so I did. Only to find a month later, after 2 or 3 interviews, that I'd start working at Santander using Java and Camel.
I had never heard of Camel by that time, and I remember the first days at my first dev job seeing that weird code sintax (Camel uses a custom language combined with regular Java code). Nevertheless, I started eating code. I bought a course on Udemy about Camel, practiced every single day, and after 3 or 4 months, I became an excellent Java/Camel programmer, and both Java and Camel got their spot on my heart, to the point that I can easily say that Java is the language that I dominate at the moment, and I'll be following the Java path until I find something more interesting to work with. That was the story of my Dev Journey so far. I'm sure many more chapters will come.
