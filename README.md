## 🇧🇷 👨‍💻 Hello!  

I'm Michel, a self-taught developer from Brazil with strong communication skills.
Currently working at a multinational bank as a Senior Software Engineer, focused on backend development using Java and Python.

I'm also the founder of [TechStrike Game Studio](https://github.com/TechStrikeBrasil) — an indie Brazilian game studio — and [TechStrike IT Support](https://github.com/TechStrike-IT-Support), a small company where I manage the IT infrastructure for a large client in São Paulo.

My current goal is to publish high-quality Brazilian games. I'm currently leaning into C#, Unity, and mobile development.

If you're working on exciting projects involving C#, .NET (backend), Unity (games), or .NET MAUI (mobile), feel free to connect — I'd love to chat!

## 🚀 Current Projects

* 🎮 **Verdant Valley** — a cozy farming game inspired by classics like *Harvest Moon*. Now available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.techstrikebrasil.verdantvalley&hl=en).
* 🧙‍♂️ **HexPG** — a modular, turn-based RPG campaign platform inspired by *For The King* and *D&D*. Currently in development — iterating on my [HexMap Project](https://github.com/mikxingu/hexmap_editor).
